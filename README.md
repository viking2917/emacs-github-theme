# emacs-github-theme
emacs (Aquamacs) code to theme/style/color code approximately the same as github ca 2018.

an emacs theme file, and associated .emacs config code, to make your code resemble Github's code view, as of Nov 2018. 

Assumes the use of web-mode (primarily for html/css files). See: http://web-mode.org/ for details about web mode. 

I've only tested this with javascript, php, html and css files. 

YMMV.
